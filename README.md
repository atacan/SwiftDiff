# SwiftDiff

SwiftDiff is a (partial) port of the [Google Diff, Match and Patch Library (google-diff-match-patch)](https://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/) to Swift. The Google Diff, Match and Patch Library was originally written by [Neil Fraser](http://neil.fraser.name). 

So far only the diff algorithm has been ported. It allows comparing two blocks of plain text and efficiently returning a list of their differences. It supports detecting in-line text differences.

SwiftDiff was updated to Swift 5 and SPM 5.1 by Cyberfun
